## **A GOOD DEVELOPER MINDSET**

___

<br>

- <p> You should understand the purpose of the software to build a good software, a simple system that can help people.</p>


-  <p>Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.</p>





- <p>Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.</p>




- <p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</p>
- <p> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. </p>




- <p>thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.</p>


- <p>Consistency is a big part of simplicity. 

- <p>The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.</p>

- <p>Solving Problems is understanding , planning , and dividing</p>

- <p>Perfect is the enemy of good.</p>

- <p>Don’t predict to future.</p>


- <p>Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. </p>

- <p>Stop reinventing</p>


- <p>As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.</p>

- <p>Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks.</p>

- <p>The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.</p>

- <p>Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible.</p>

- <p>Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.</p>

- <p>Everything takes longer than you think.</p>

- <p>Refactoring should be the first option.</p>

- <p>When you can’t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity.</p>

- <p>Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
</p>

- <p>Keep learning. </p>

- <p>A lot of times it’s better to be a quitter than a hero.</p>

- <p>Don’t Ask Questions … Ask For Help … But always seek advice.</p>
